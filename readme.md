# Kaggle House Prices
My submission of the ["House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/) competition on Kaggle.
In this challenge, the final house price had to be predicted using a machine learning model based on 79 variables.
I used a blended model to combine the predictions of a XGBRegressor, LassoCV, RidgeCV, ElasticNetCV, SVR and a stacked model (see kaggle_HousePrices.ipynb)
